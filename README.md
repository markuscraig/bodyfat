## Golang Body Fat Calculator

Implements the following body-fat calculators as a Golang package...

1. 'Durnin and Womersly' method
2. _tbd_

## Examples

See the 'cmd' directory for simple examples.

## Measurements

Each body measurement is taken in millimeters using cheap body-fat calipers.

Existing body-fat weight-scales are grossly inaccurate; relying on an electrical signal sent across both feet to estimate body-fat.  This method only estimates the lower half of the body's fat percentage.
